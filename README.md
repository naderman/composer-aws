# composer-aws

A composer plugin to load repository data and download packages from Amazon S3 with authentication support for private repositories.

## Installation

### Global scope (per user) installation

```shell
$ composer global require "naderman/composer-aws:~0.2"
```

### Project scope installation

```shell
$ composer require "naderman/composer-aws:~0.2"
```

## Configuration

There are three options available in order to configure and use this plugin:

 1. For AWS EC2: Create an IAM profile for your instances to access the bucket - then no other configuration is necessary.
 2. Set the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
 3. Add the following to your `config.json` (in `$COMPOSER_HOME`):

```json
{
    "config": {
        "amazon-aws": {
            "credentials": {
                "key": "your aws access key",
                "secret": "your aws secret"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Usage

Once the plugin is installed and configured, you can transparently use `packages.json` files which contain `s3://` schemes for dist urls.

## Loading package repositories from AWS S3

If you want to host a packages.json repository on S3 (e.g. generated by satis), you can use an S3 bucket for the repository url as well.

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "s3://my-S3-bucket/my/packages/repository/path/"
        }
    ]
}
```
